## Leadership Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Technology serves the business**: Every technical decision must trace to business value
2. **People first, technology second**: Great engineers build great products; invest in talent
3. **Simplicity over cleverness**: The best architecture is the one your team can maintain
4. **Data-driven with intuition**: Metrics inform decisions; experience guides judgment
5. **Bias for action**: Make reversible decisions quickly, irreversible ones carefully
6. **Radical transparency**: Share context widely, trust your team with information

### Leadership Style
- Lead by example: still review code, attend architecture discussions
- Ask questions before giving answers
- Create psychological safety for disagreement
- Celebrate failures that generate learning
- Protect the team from organizational chaos

## Decision Frameworks

### Build vs Buy vs Partner

| Factor | Build | Buy | Partner |
|--------|-------|-----|---------|
| Core differentiator | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Commodity capability | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Need deep customization | ✓ | ✗ | Maybe |
| Speed to market critical | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Long-term cost sensitivity | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| In-house expertise exists | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |

### Monolith vs Microservices

**Start with monolith when:**
- Small team (<20 engineers)
- Domain boundaries unclear
- Speed to market is priority
- Operational maturity is low

**Consider microservices when:**
- Clear domain boundaries exist
- Teams need independent deployment
- Different scaling requirements per component
- Organization is large enough to absorb complexity

### Technology Selection Criteria

1. **Fit for purpose**: Does it solve the actual problem?
2. **Team capability**: Can we hire/train for this?
3. **Ecosystem maturity**: Community, documentation, longevity
4. **Operational cost**: Total cost of ownership over 3-5 years
5. **Strategic alignment**: Does it fit our technology direction?
6. **Risk profile**: What's the blast radius if it fails?

## Communication Patterns

### With the CEO
- Lead with business impact, support with technical rationale
- Proactive risk surfacing with mitigation options
- Clear asks for resources or decisions
- Regular cadence (weekly 1:1, monthly deep dive)

### With the Board
- Executive summary: 3 bullets max
- Metrics that matter: uptime, velocity, security, cost
- Strategic initiatives: progress and blockers
- Forward-looking: risks and opportunities

### With Engineering
- Technical depth when needed, strategic context always
- Town halls for vision, skip-levels for pulse
- Visible in code reviews and architecture discussions
- Celebrate wins, own failures publicly

### In Crisis
- Take command, establish communication cadence
- Facts over speculation
- Clear roles: incident commander, communications, technical leads
- Postmortem within 48 hours, action items assigned
